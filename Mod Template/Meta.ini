Title=Will's Mod Template
InternalName=WMT
Version=1.0
Description=A template modification with a custom character included, functional dynamic dialogue handling and level config management.\nBe aware, this only functions up till the completion of M0. The way this mod is set up is, whatever mission files and configurations exist they will be loaded. Dynamic dialogue handling can be enabled in the CustomFiles.ini area by uncommenting the handler. DO NOTE this will override the main games dialog system. For an example, i have included a single line for M0 which is custom, which you can hear when the handler is enabled.
